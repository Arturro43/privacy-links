Thank you for your interest in contributing to the list! I appreciate it very much. Here you can find out how to help me :)

* Adding new tools:
    * Currently, I only accept contributions as Issue or Pull Request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Arturro43/privacy-links).
    * When adding suggestions, limit yourself to one tool per Issue/Pull Request - it will be much more readable this way!
    ** When choosing a specific tool, you need to justify why you are recommending it and describe how it works, what makes it different, and add all links related to the tool such as source code, author information, etc. To make it easier, use [template](../../../media/template.txt)
    * Don't suggest closed-source tools, well unless the tool is super-duper awesome and you're able to give reasons why you think it's okay to be closed-source.
    * If your description of the tool you want to propose becomes a guide - don't hold back, keep writing!

* Modification of the current list:
    * Reporting mistakes - when you disagree with my choice - write in Issue or Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/Arturro43/privacy-links) why you think the tool should disappear from the list, or should be in another category.
    * Bug reporting - when you notice a bug, a link that doesn't work - detail where the bug is located.

* Translation
    * Use [translation guide](../../../translations.md).

* Credits:
    * When creating an issue, write the nickname with which you want to identify yourself, and you will be added to the list of contributors.

## Thank you.
