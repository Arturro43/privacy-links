**4. Moved:**

  **4.1 Messengers:**  

    4.1.1 Telegram from Worth a shot to Avoid. Telegram currently (March 2024) is one of the few mainstream messengers that still does not support end to end encryption by default. Additionally, transparency is lacking. There are known cases where Telegram was asked for data on some users, handed it over, but the fact that it was ordered to do so was not reported in any publicly available report. Moreover, the reports were previously “available” to everyone as a channel on Telegram, but now they are presented only to users from a particular country - if you are from Poland, you won't see what happened in another country. This is not transparency.  

    4.1.2 Matrix clients (instead of linking the three popular ones, the link to the list of clients created by Matrix is given) from the Use category to Worth a shot, due to the fact that Matrix suffers from many problems such as metadata. These problems have not been solved for years, so I do not think it is reasonable to recommend Matrix in the Use category.  

    4.1.3 Session from the Use category to Worth a shot. Session is a strange project. Initially it seemed like a reasonable alternative to Signal, but the decision to remove Perfect Forward Secrecy, for example, is strange, as is the model in which messages along with metadata are flying all over the Session network for 14 days until the message is received by the recipient. Hosting your own node comes at quite a cost - we have to freeze a large sum of OXEN cryptocurrency. That's not how you make a decentralized messenger.  

    4.1.4 tinfoilchat (tfc) from the Worth a shot category to Use. TFC is an incredibly interesting project.
