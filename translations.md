# Privacy Links - translation guide

As contributor for [SimpleX Chat](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat) I know translation can be very overwhelming and tedious. This document is here to help you with translating Privacy-Links to your language. Feel free to add any languages you want - let's spread privacy across the globe!

## How to translate Privacy Links?

Fork repository and start working. All translations are in the "lang" directory.

Create new directory in lang directory named "ISO632SET1CODEOFYOURLANG" (eg. lang/cz) with subdirectory named "sites" containing "about.md" and "contribute.md".
In the main directory create README.md and changelog.md. Please, translate everything. If you want, you can also include and translate translations.md. It would help a lot!

All files under lang/en are preconfigured to support other languages.

When finished, create Pull request. After review your translation are going to be added to the next release of privacy links! Please write your username in the PR comment. If you want to stay anonymous, inform me about it. If you want full privacy please contact me via mail/DM (visit [my github](https://github.com/Arturro43) for more informations).

## Style of Privacy Links

Privacy Links is for masses. Privacy should be accessible to anyone. Your translations should be written in an informal style. Use jokes, don't translate everything 1:1, add something from you :)

## I need more help with translation!

Please, create Issue regarding your problem. Use "[Translation] Need help with <language> translation" as topic for the issue. I'll try to explain everything. If it's a problem which I can't solve (eg. you need help from other people using your language to make translation better) use "[Translation] Need community help with <language> translation. Input needed" as topic for the issue.
