# Contributor License Agreement

## Foreword

I want to make it as simple as possible. I don't want to use your work to earn money, I want your contribution to be used for creation of something amazing. For the people, by the people. I don't understand how does copyright work, especially how to protect your contributions from stealing. That's why you are reading this. I know, Grant of Rights section sounds kinda bonkers, but that's what I came up with. If you know any better way to solve this problem, please contact me

You need to trust me, your contribution is not going to make me rich. I want to protect your work and the project itself.

- I'm trying to protect your work from stealing.
- You give me (and only me) rights for your work to be transformed and/or modified and/or adapted.
- You'll be credited for your work. You'll be always visible on the contributors list, unless you choose to be anonymous.
- After publishing, your work is going to be licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
